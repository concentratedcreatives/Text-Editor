# WEEK 19 Homework (text Editor)
## Description:

This project is a browser-based text editor designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It leverages modern web technologies and adheres to PWA criteria, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices and offline functionality. The text editor utilizes IndexedDB for data persistence, implementing methods for storing and retrieving data using the idb package, a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. With redundancy built into its data storage techniques, this text editor ensures reliability even in scenarios where certain options are unsupported by the browser.
